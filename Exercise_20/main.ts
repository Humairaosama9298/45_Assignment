// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

// Exercise_20

// store languages in array
let languages:string[] = ["Arabic","Urdu","English","Sindhi","French","Spanish","Japanese"];

console.log("List of Languages:");

// creats a list
languages.forEach((language) => {
    console.log(language); 
});
