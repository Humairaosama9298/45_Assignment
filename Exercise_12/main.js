// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
// Exercise_12
// friend name array
let friend_name = ["Asma", "Hira", "Nabeela", "Amna", "Erum", "Sana"];
// for loop 
for (let i = 0; i < friend_name.length; i++) {
    console.log(friend_name[i], "Hey, hope you're doing well! Just thinking about you and wanted to say hi.");
}
export {};
